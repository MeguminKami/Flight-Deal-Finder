# ✈️ Flight Deal Finder — Simple Guide

A friendly app that helps you **discover cheap round‑trip flight ideas** based on **recent airfare snapshots** (not live airline prices). It’s built for people who want inspiration fast — then confirm and book wherever you prefer.

---

## What you can do

- **Start from any origin airport** (type to search).
- Explore deals to:
  - **One specific airport**
  - **Anywhere in the world**
  - A **continent**
  - A **country**
- Choose a **date window** (when you could travel).
- Choose **trip length** (e.g., 3–5 days, 7–10 days).
- Browse results as “deal cards” showing:
  - route (from → to)
  - dates and trip duration
  - whether it’s **direct** or has **stops**
  - estimated price (EUR)

---

## How it works (in plain language)

1. You tell the app:
   - where you’re flying from,
   - where you want to explore (specific place / region / anywhere),
   - the dates you’re open to,
   - and how long you want to travel.

2. The app looks up **recently observed prices** from a flight‑search data source.

3. It shows you the best matches it can find, then gives you buttons to:
   - **Open Google Flights** (to confirm price and view real options)
   - **Open Booking** (to start planning stays for those dates)

---

## Important: prices are not live

This app is a **deal discovery tool**, not a booking engine.

That means:
- The prices are often **a few days old**
- Some routes may show **no results** (especially uncommon routes)
- Prices can change quickly — always **confirm before buying**

Best mindset:  
**“Inspiration + shortlist” → then validate on Google Flights → then book.**

## What makes a “good” search

If you’re not seeing much, try:
- widening your date window (even +7 days helps)
- increasing max trip length (e.g., from 5 to 10 days)
- exploring a continent or country instead of one airport
- trying another origin airport nearby
- searching popular hubs (major cities often have more data)

## FAQs

### Is this a booking app?
No. It helps you **find ideas** and then sends you to other sites to **confirm and book**.

### Why do some destinations show nothing?
Sometimes there simply isn’t recent data available for that route/date window. Try broader filters.

### Why is the price different when I open Google Flights?
Because prices are not live. Airlines update prices constantly, and availability changes.

### Does it include baggage, seats, or airline fees?
Typically no. Treat the displayed price as a **starting point**, then confirm full details on Google Flights.

### Can I search one‑way flights?
This app focuses on **round‑trip** deal discovery.

### What currency are prices shown in?
Prices are shown in **EUR**.

### Does it work offline?
You can open the app, but searching needs an internet connection to fetch flight‑price data.

### Is my data private?
Yes:
- The app runs on your computer.
- It does not upload your personal history anywhere.
- It only requests flight‑price data to fulfill the searches you run.
